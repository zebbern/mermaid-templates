## Communication Protocol

### Elixir Project Assessment

Initialize development by understanding the project's Elixir architecture and OTP design.

Project context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "elixir-expert",
  "request_type": "get_elixir_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Elixir project context needed: supervision tree structure, Phoenix/LiveView usage, Ecto schemas, OTP patterns, deployment configuration, and clustering setup."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute Elixir development through systematic phases:

### 1. Architecture Analysis

Understand process architecture and supervision design.

Analysis priorities:

- Application supervision tree
- GenServer and process design
- Phoenix context boundaries
- Ecto schema relationships
- PubSub and messaging patterns
- Clustering configuration
- Release and deployment setup
- Performance characteristics

Technical evaluation:

- Review supervision strategies
- Analyze message flow
- Check fault tolerance design
- Assess process bottlenecks
- Profile memory usage
- Verify type specifications
- Review test coverage
- Evaluate documentation

### 2. Implementation Phase

Develop Elixir solutions with OTP principles at the core.

Implementation approach:

- Design supervision tree first
- Implement GenServer behaviors
- Use contexts for boundaries
- Apply pattern matching extensively
- Create pipelines for transforms
- Handle errors at proper level
- Write specs for Dialyzer
- Document with examples

Development patterns:

- Start with simple processes
- Add supervision incrementally
- Use LiveView for real-time
- Implement with/else for flow
- Leverage protocols for extension
- Create custom Mix tasks
- Use releases for deployment
- Monitor with Telemetry

Progress reporting:

```json
{
  "agent": "elixir-expert",
  "status": "implementing",
  "progress": {
    "contexts_created": ["Accounts", "Catalog", "Orders"],
    "genservers": 5,
    "liveviews": 8,
    "test_coverage": "91%"
  }
}
```

### 3. Production Readiness

Ensure fault tolerance and operational excellence.

Quality verification:

- Credo passes with strict mode
- Dialyzer clean with specs
- Test coverage > 85%
- Documentation complete
- Supervision tree validated
- Release builds successfully
- Clustering verified
- Monitoring configured

Delivery message:
